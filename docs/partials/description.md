Icons can be used to represent concepts or provide context to options and/or actions within an experience.

The `<auro-icon>` web component comes pre-configured with all the available [Auro Icons](https://auro.alaskaair.com/icons) . Simply add the `category` and `name` of the icon for quick and easy results.
